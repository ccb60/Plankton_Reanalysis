# Introduction
This notebook takes the OUTPUT of the NMDS analyses and looks at how well each 
synthetic NMDS axis can be predicted based on models akin to what we used to
analyze total zooplankton abundance, diversity and individual species. 

The flow of analyses is as follows:

1. Conduct the NMDS analysis (mimicking Erin's original NMDS plot)

2. Plot the results color coded to show major relationships with predictors

3. Conduct a linear analysis of relationship to each predictors using the
`envfit()` function included in the `vegan` package.

4. Conduct GAM analyses of the synthetic axis scores from the NMDS.

# Load Libraries
```{r libraries}
library(tidyverse)
library(vegan)
library(readxl)
library(mgcv)      # for GAM models
library(emmeans)   # For extracting useful "marginal" model summaries
```

# Set Graphics Theme
This sets `ggplot()`graphics for no background, no grid lines, etc. in a clean
format suitable for (some) publications.
```{r set_theme}
theme_set(theme_classic())
```

# Folder References
I use folder references to allow limited indirection, thus making code from 
GitHub repositories more likely to run "out of the box".
```{r folder_refs}
data_folder <- "Original_Data"
```

# Input Data
##  Environmental Data
This is the data source used by Erin. For our purposes, I believe it is 
identical, except for the dropped May 2015 sample.  Code is retained here in 
case I need it later.
```{r load_enviro_data}
filename.in <- "penob.station.data EA 3.12.20.xlsx"
file_path <- file.path(data_folder, filename.in)
station_data <- read_excel(file_path, 
                           sheet="NMDS Happy", col_types = c("skip", "date", 
                                              "numeric", "text", "skip", 
                                              "numeric", "skip", "numeric", 
                                              "numeric", "numeric", "numeric", 
                                              "numeric", "numeric", "numeric", 
                                              "numeric", "numeric", "numeric", 
                                              "numeric", "numeric", "numeric", 
                                              "numeric", "numeric", "numeric",

                                              "numeric", "numeric", "numeric", 
                                              "numeric", "numeric", "numeric", 
                                              "numeric", "numeric", "numeric", 
                                              "numeric", "numeric", "numeric", 
                                              "numeric", "numeric", "numeric", 
                                              "numeric", "numeric", "numeric", 
                                              "numeric", "numeric", "numeric", 
                                              "numeric", "numeric", "numeric", 
                                              "numeric", "numeric", "numeric", 
                                              "numeric", "numeric", "numeric", 
                                              "numeric", "numeric", "numeric", 
                                              "numeric", "numeric", "text")) %>%
  rename_with(~ gsub(" ", "_", .x)) %>%
  rename_with(~ gsub("\\.", "_", .x))
```


The  data read in from a different data sheet ("Final").  This is the data sheet
I used for all other analyses. I like to use the same environment data for all
different analyses.

```{r change_station_names_1}
station_data_2 <- read_excel(file_path, 
                           sheet="Final", col_types = c("skip", "date", 
                                              "numeric", "text", "skip", 
                                              "text", "skip", "skip", 
                                              "skip", 
                                              rep("numeric", 10),
                                              "text", 
                                              rep("numeric", 47),
                                              "text",
                                              rep("numeric", 12))) %>%
  rename_with(~ gsub(" ", "_", .x)) %>%
  rename_with(~ gsub("\\.", "_", .x)) %>%
  rename_with(~ gsub("\\?", "", .x)) %>%
  rename_with(~ gsub("%", "pct", .x)) %>%
  rename_with(~ gsub("_Abundance", "", .x)) %>%
  filter(! is.na(date)) %>%
  filter(! (station == 8 & month == 'May' & year == 2015))
```

Station names are arbitrary, and Ambrose expressed interest in renaming them
from Stations 2, 4, 5 and 8 to Stations 1,2,3,and 4.

The `factor()` function by default sorts levels before assigning numeric codes,
so a convenient way to replace the existing station codes with sequential
numbers is to create a factor and extract the numeric indicator values with 
`as.numeric()`.

```{r}
station_data <- station_data_2 %>%
  mutate(station = factor(as.numeric(factor(station)))) %>%
  mutate(season = case_when(month == 'May' ~ 'Spring',
                             month == 'July' ~ 'Summer',
                             TRUE ~ 'Fall')) %>%
  relocate(season, .after = month) %>%
  relocate(station, .after = season)
```

Here  I mostly select the depth-averaged water chemistry parameters, create
short names that will work in later analyses and graphics and convert some
variables to factors to control later analyses.

```{r build_env_data_2}
station_data <- station_data %>%
  rename(Date = date, 
         Station = station,
         Year = year) %>%
  select(-c(month)) %>%
  mutate(Month = factor(as.numeric(format(Date, format = '%m')),
                                                levels = 1:12, 
                                                labels = month.abb),
         DOY = as.numeric(format(Date,format = '%j')),
         season = factor(season, levels = c('Spring', 'Summer', 'Fall')),
         Yearf = factor(Year)) %>%
  rename(Season = season,
         Temp = ave_temp_c,
         Sal = ave_sal_psu,
         Turb = sur_turb,
         AvgTurb = ave_turb_ntu,
         DOsat = ave_DO_Saturation,
         Chl = ave_chl_microgperl,
         RH = Herring
         ) %>%
  select(Date, Station, Year, Yearf, Month, Season, DOY, riv_km, Temp, Sal, Turb, AvgTurb, 
         DOsat, Chl, RH) %>%
  arrange(Date, Station)
head(station_data)
```

## Composition Data
```{r load_composition_data}
filename.in <- "Penobscot_Zooplankton and field data_EA_2.13.20.xlsx"
file_path <- file.path(data_folder, filename.in)
zoopl <- read_excel(file_path,
                    sheet = "NMDS Happy",
                    col_types = c("date", 
                                  "text", "numeric", "numeric", "text", 
                                  "text", "text", "text", "text", "text", 
                                  "text", "numeric", "text", "text", 
                                  "numeric", "numeric", "numeric", 
                                  "text", "text", "text", "numeric", 
                                  "numeric", "numeric", "numeric")) %>%
  select(-c(`...20`:`...24`)) %>%
  rename_with(~ gsub(" ", "_", .x))
```

We renumber the stations here as well. The code is similar.
```{r change_station_names_2}
zoopl <- zoopl %>%
  mutate(STATION = factor(as.numeric(factor(STATION))))
zoopl
```

## Turn Data from Long to Wide
This code generates a total abundance for each taxa by site and date and pivots 
it to wide format. The code is more compact that what Erin used, but slightly 
more opaque because it relies on several options of the `pivot_wider()` 
function.

```{r aggregate_zoopl_data}
zoopl2 <- zoopl %>%
  pivot_wider(c(DATE, Month, Year, STATION), 
              names_from = NAME, 
              names_sort = TRUE,
              values_from = CORRECTED_PERCENT_ABUNDANCE, 
  values_fn = sum,
  values_fill = 0)
zoopl2
```

## Check for Dropped Sample
Erin Ambrose dropped 5/20/15 Station 8 from both datasheets. 
Environmental and zooplankton data should each have 59 rows, and they do.

Erin notes that there was no zooplankton "sample" (?) only nekton for that
sample.  I'm not sure if that means no sample was collected or there were no 
zooplankton in the sample.  Anyway, she noted that this sample "threw 
off calculation of percent abundances." 

Note that that sample is one of the Spring "washout" samples that
cause trouble on our other analyses as well.

```{r}
sum(! is.na((zoopl2 %>%
  filter((STATION == 4 & Month == 'May' & Year == 2015))))) == 0
sum(! is.na(station_data %>%
  filter((Station == 4 & Month == 'May' & Year == 2015)))) == 0
```

## Correct Sample Row Alignment
I had some funny artifacts popping up in my initial (re) analyses, which I
finally tracked down to the fact that the two data sets as I assembled them were
in a different order from how Erin pulled them together. That is just because 
I used different tools that have different default ordering. Getting the data in 
alignment from two different datasheets in Excel is critical. SO, I force that
alignment here.

## Align Data Tables
```{r}
zoopl2 <- zoopl2 %>%
  arrange(DATE, STATION)
station_data<- station_data %>%
  arrange(Date, Station)

head(zoopl2[,c(1,4)])
head(station_data[,c(1,2)])
```

## Matrix of Species for `vegan`
The `vegan` package likes to work with a matrix of species occurrences. Although 
the matrix can have row names that provide sample identifiers, that was not
done here. The "matrix" I produce here is really a data frame with
nothing but numeric values. While those are  different data structures
internally, `vegan` handles the conversion in the background.

```{r make_cdata}
CDATA <- zoopl2[,-c(1:4)]
```

## Data Sanity Checks 
We should have no NAs, and row sums should all be 1 (100%), at least within 
reasonable rounding error. 
```{r sanity_check}
anyNA(CDATA)
plot(rowSums(CDATA))
```

# NMDS Analyses 
```{r nmds}
NMDSE <- metaMDS(CDATA, autotransform = FALSE, k = 2, trymax = 75)
NMDSE
```

## Plot
```{r plot_nmds}
plot(NMDSE, type = 'p')
```

## Plot Species
```{r plot_nmds_spp, fig.width = 7, fig.height = 5}
plot(NMDSE, 'species', type = 't')
```

# Combining the NMDS Results with Environmental Data
I want to use the names of these variables as labels in graphics later.
I capitalize variable names here, so they will appear capitalized in graphics 
without further action on my part.

```{r build_env_data_1}
envNMDS <- station_data %>%
  select(-Date, -Month, -DOY, -riv_km, -AvgTurb) %>%
  mutate(Turb2 = log(Turb),
         Chl2 = log(Chl),
         RH2 = log1p(RH)) %>%
  mutate(sample_seq = as.numeric(Season) + (Year-2013)*3,
         sample_event = factor(sample_seq)) %>%
  cbind(as_tibble(NMDSE$points))
```

# Plotting
These plots are intended principally to help us understand the NMDS from a more 
intuitive perspective.  The idea is to plot the ordination, but colored by various
predictor variables.

## By Station
```{r nmds_by_station, fig.width = 3, fig.height = 2.5}
ggplot(envNMDS, aes(MDS1, MDS2)) +
    geom_point(aes(color=Station)) +
  xlim(c(-1.5,1)) +
  ylim(c(-1.5,1)) +
  theme(aspect.ratio=1)
```

Note that station 1 is split into a group along the upper edge and two points 
along the lower edge. The stations don't segregate fully, but there are trends.
Other than those two spring samples, Station 1 is upper edge. Station 2 is
upper zone as well. I suspect those two samples are "washout" event samples.

## By Year
```{r, nmds_by_year, fig.width = 3, fig.height = 2.5}
ggplot(envNMDS, aes(MDS1, MDS2)) +
  geom_point(aes(color=Yearf)) +
  xlim(c(-1.5,1)) +
  ylim(c(-1.5,1)) +
  theme(aspect.ratio=1)
```

MAYBE 2016 is towards the upper edge, but it's not clear at all.  I don't see a
robust pattern here.

## By Season
```{r, nmds_by_season, fig.width = 3, fig.height = 2.5}
ggplot(envNMDS, aes(MDS1, MDS2)) +
  geom_point(aes(color=Season)) +
  xlim(c(-1.5,1)) +
  ylim(c(-1.5,1)) +
  theme(aspect.ratio=1)
```

Note the VERY strong association here, with Spring samples all to the left on 
the plot.  Summer and Fall plots are fairly mixed up, but all to the left. That 
means Axis 1 can be interpreted as largely a "season" signal. 

## By Temperature
```{r, nmds_by_temp, fig.width = 3, fig.height = 2.5}
ggplot(envNMDS, aes(MDS1, MDS2)) +
  geom_point(aes(color=Temp)) +
  xlim(c(-1.5,1)) +
  ylim(c(-1.5,1)) +
  theme(aspect.ratio=1)
```

This reveals the same pattern as the last graphic, only filtered through the
correlation between season and temperature.  Cool temperatures in spring to the 
left.

## By Salinity
```{r, nmds_by_salinity, fig.width = 3, fig.height = 2.5}
ggplot(envNMDS, aes(MDS1, MDS2)) +
  geom_point(aes(color=Sal)) +
  xlim(c(-1.5,1)) +
  ylim(c(-1.5,1)) +
  theme(aspect.ratio=1)
```

This one is hard to interpret. What jumps out at me here is the two VERY low 
salinity sites at the bottom, and the tendency for other lower salinity samples
to fall to the left (spring) and along the upper edge ( Station 1).

## By Turbidity
```{r, nmds_by_turb, fig.width = 3, fig.height = 2.5}
ggplot(envNMDS, aes(MDS1, MDS2)) +
  geom_point(aes(color=log(Turb))) +
  xlim(c(-1.5,1)) +
  ylim(c(-1.5,1)) +
  theme(aspect.ratio=1)
```

## By Chlorophyll
```{r, nmds_by_chl, fig.width = 3, fig.height = 2.5}
ggplot(envNMDS, aes(MDS1, MDS2)) +
  geom_point(aes(color=log(Chl))) +
  xlim(c(-1.5,1)) +
  ylim(c(-1.5,1)) +
  theme(aspect.ratio=1)
```

## By Oxygen Saturation
```{r, nmds_by_dosat, fig.width = 3, fig.height = 2.5}
ggplot(envNMDS, aes(MDS1, MDS2)) +
  geom_point(aes(color=DOsat)) +
  xlim(c(-1.5,1)) +
  ylim(c(-1.5,1)) +
  theme(aspect.ratio=1)
```


Note that highest DO is to the left, providing an alternate "explanation" to
considering axis 1 a seasonal axis.

# Using `envfit` to Estimate Correlations
The `envfit()` function is fitting linear predictors to the two NMDS axes 
jointly. The related help file says "The environmental variables are the 
dependent variables that are explained by the ordination scores, and each 
dependent variable is analyzed separately." The model is always linear, which 
is different from our GAM models.

Despite that description, the R squared terms don't match R squared from 
linear models, so something else is going on here.

That means this is NOT a single statistical test, but a separate statistical fit 
for each predictor variable.  Coefficients are the coordinates of a unit-length
vector that points along the "direction" in ordination space that shows maximum 
correlation with the NMDS scores. So, if one goes up, the other necessarily goes 
down. The R2 term "is a "goodness of fit statistic" like the one from multiple 
regression models.  The higher the number, the better the ability of the 
ordination scores to predict environmental variables

It's worth remembering that these results are based on randomization methods, so
results change somewhat between repeated model runs.  The relatively high
number of permutations specified here helps keep those effects small.

## Create Working Environmental Data
```{r env_fit}
ef <- envfit(NMDSE, envNMDS[,c(1, 3:12)], permu = 9999, na.rm = TRUE)
ef
```
Note 13 observations deleted due to missingness. Those must mostly be the
2013 data, which lack DO data. We can refit to include those data by dropping DO
as a predictor.

## Extracting Vector Information 
The `ef` object is an `envfit` S3 object, with three named slots. The vector
information we need to plot the environment arrows is available in `vectors`.
But that object is itself also an S3 object, with five named items. The help
page for `envfit()` tells us that the information we need for the direction of
the arrows is in the `arrows` component. We are told that arrows contain
"Arrow endpoints from vectorfit. The arrows are scaled to unit length."

```{r what_is_arrows}
ef$vectors$arrows
```

The information we need to determine the magnitude of those vectors is in the
`r` component of the `vectors` component. We scale each of the arrows by the
square root of the related r squared value.

```{r scaled_arrows}
arrows <- ef$vectors$arrows
rsq    <- ef$vectors$r
scaled_arrows <- as_tibble(arrows*sqrt(rsq)) %>%  
  mutate(parameter = rownames(arrows))
```

While we are creating vectors, we also want to create points for placing the 
annotations identifying each vector. We want to space the labels so they are a
fixed distance beyond the end of each vector. We do that with a little vector 
addition.

```{r anotation_positions_1}
scale_factor = 0.3   # Fraction of unit length beyond arrow to place annotation

scaled_arrows <- scaled_arrows %>%
  mutate(ann_xpos = NMDS1 + arrows[,1] * scale_factor,
         ann_ypos = NMDS2 + arrows[,2] * scale_factor)
```

## Plotting `envfit()` Information
```{r draft_arrow+plot}
plt <- ggplot(data = envNMDS, aes(MDS1, MDS2)) + 
  geom_point(aes(color = Season), size = 2.5) +
  geom_segment(data=scaled_arrows,  
               mapping = aes(x=0,xend=ann_xpos,y=0,yend=ann_ypos),
               arrow = arrow(length = unit(0.25, "cm")) ,colour="grey40") + 
  geom_text(data=scaled_arrows, 
            mapping = aes(x=1.1 * ann_xpos,
                          y=1.1 * ann_ypos,label=parameter),
            size=4, nudge_x =0, nudge_y = 0, hjust = .5)+
  scale_color_viridis_d(option = 'C', name = 'Season') +
  coord_fixed()
plt
```

This is where the fact that the `envfit()` analysis is parameter by parameter
gets a bit irritating. Temperature and dissolved oxygen are negatively
correlated, for purely physical reasons. 

It's also interesting that the turbidity and river herring arrows are nearly 
perpendicular to the temperature / DO arrows, suggesting nearly independent 
relationships to the community data.


*  Axis 1 is season, which is highly correlated with temperature and
   dissolved oxygen, and less strongly associated with salinity.
   
*  Axis 2 is LARGELY River Herring and Turbidity (which are themselves weakly
   correlated).  Another vision is to see this axis as more or less a skewed
   upstream-downstream pattern. I am uncertain how to interpret the Chlorophyll
   association.

# GAM Analysis
## Axis 1
```{r}
gam_1 <- gamm(MDS1 ~ 
               Station + 
               Season +
               s(Temp, bs="ts") +
               s(Sal, bs="ts") + 
               s(log(Turb), bs="ts") + 
               s(log(Chl), bs="ts") + 
               s(log1p(RH),bs="ts"),
              random = list(Yearf = ~ 1, sample_event = ~ 1),
             data = envNMDS, family = 'gaussian')
summary(gam_1$gam)

```

```{r}
anova(gam_1$gam)
```

```{r}
oldpar <- par(mfrow = c(2,3))
plot(gam_1$gam)
par(oldpar)
```

As we saw from the `envfit()` analysis, Axis 1 is associated with the SEASON,
with spring clearly separated from Summer and Fall. Temperature is also 
important in GAM analysis (note that the relationship is essentially linear).
Last, I see a possible connection to River Herring.  Essentially, low Axis 1 
Scores are spring, with lower temperatures.

```{r fig.width = 5, fig.height = 5}
oldpar <- par(mfrow = c(2,2))
gam.check(gam_1$gam)
par(oldpar)
```

The model is fairly well behaved.  No problems obvious here.

## Axis 2
```{r}
gam_2 <- gamm(MDS2 ~ 
               Station + 
               Season +
               s(Temp, bs="ts") +
               s(Sal, bs="ts") + 
               s(log(Turb), bs="ts") + 
               s(log(Chl), bs="ts") +

```{r}
anova(gam_2$gam)

```{r}
oldpar <- par(mfrow = c(2,3))
plot(gam_2$gam)
par(oldpar)
```

Axis 2 shows the effect of a couple of low salinity samples, which are very low 
on Axis # 2. But the big story here is the connection with station.
It will be worth comparing pairwise marginal means.

```{r fig.width = 5, fig.height = 5}
oldpar <- par(mfrow = c(2,2))
gam.check(gam_2$gam)
par(oldpar)
```

Again, it looks like the low salinity samples have a disproportionate effect.
Otherwise, this model looks fairly robust.

### Pairwise Comparisons
```{r fig.width = 3, fig.height = 2}
Sta_emms <- emmeans(gam_2, ~Station, type = 'response', 
                    data = envNMDS)
plot(Sta_emms)
pairs(Sta_emms, adjust ='bonferroni')
```

The big story is that Axis 2 is associated with the differences between Stations
1 and 2 (high values) and Stations 3 and 4.  It is curious that this model does
not pull out differences according to Turbidity, since Turbidity also differs 
the same way.
