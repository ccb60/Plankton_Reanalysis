# Reanalysis of Data on Penobscot Bay Plankton

Erin Ambrose recently prepared a manuscript based on her graduate work looking 
at species composition of plankton in Penobscot Bay, Maine, working with Rachel
Lasley Rasher, at the University of Southern Maine. Lasley Rasher is on the faculty 
at the University of Southern Maine, which also houses the Casco Bay Estuary 
Partnership.  So, at Lasley Rasher's request, I helped Ambrose early on in her 
graduate work with some R coding issues, and later assisted with preparing some 
graphics for teh manuscript.

Comments back from reviewers on Ambrose's manuscript raised some fairly deep 
questions about how to discuss, analyze, and visualize patterns in the complex
spatio-temporal environment of Maine estuaries.  

This repository explores ways to better analyze, present, and understand the
relationship between estuarine hydrodynamics, predictor variables, and 
zooplankton conditions.
