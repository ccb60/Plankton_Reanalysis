# Introduction
This notebook is a summary of my efforts to explore approaches to the analysis
of plankton data from the Penobscot Estuary. Here I omit most exploratory data 
analysis and most alternative model formulations, and include only final models.

This Notebook looks at:

1. ANOVA models predicting environmental variables based on Season and Station

2.  Non-linear fits between zooplankton density and possible 
    environmental drivers;
    
3.  Links between Shannon Diversity and environmental drivers

4.  A GAM model looking at environmental drivers of River Herring abundance.

5.  Responses of individual species to those same drivers.

I've trimmed down the analysis workflow, since I looked at the data
distributions, autocorrelation structure, etc. previously, but the major steps
remain the same.

Note that explicit modeling of correlation groups using hierarchical models 
proves to be fairly important in modelling these data.

file_path <- file.path(data_folder, filename.in)
station_data <- read_excel(file_path, 
                           sheet="Final", col_types = c("skip", "date", 
                                              "numeric", "text", "numeric",

                                              "text", 
                                              rep("numeric", 47),
                                              "text",

  rename_with(~ gsub(" ", "_", .x)) %>%
  rename_with(~ gsub("\\.", "_", .x)) %>%
  rename_with(~ gsub("\\?", "", .x)) %>%
  rename_with(~ gsub("%", "pct", .x)) %>%
  rename_with(~ gsub("_Abundance", "", .x)) %>%
  filter(! is.na(date))
```

Station names are arbitrary, and Erin previously expressed interest in renaming 
them from Stations 2, 4, 5 and 8 to Stations 1,2,3,and 4.

The `factor()` function by default sorts levels before assigning numeric codes,
so a convenient way to replace the existing station codes with sequential
numbers is to create a factor and extract the numeric indicator values with 
`as.numeric()`.

```{r change_station_names_2}
station_data <- station_data %>%
  mutate(station = factor(as.numeric(factor(station))))
head(station_data)
```

### Subsetting to Desired Data Columns
I base selection of predictor variables here on the ones used in the manuscript.

```{r build_env_data}
base_data <- station_data %>%
  rename(Date = date, 
         Station = station,
         Year = year) %>%
  select(-c(month, month_num)) %>%
  mutate(Month = factor(as.numeric(format(Date, format = '%m')),
                                                levels = 1:12, 
                                                labels = month.abb),
         DOY = as.numeric(format(Date,format = '%j')),
         season = factor(season, levels = c('Spring', 'Summer', 'Fall')),
         Yearf = factor(Year)) %>%
  rename(Season = season,
         Temp = ave_temp_c,
         Sal = ave_sal_psu,
         Turb = sur_turb,
         AvgTurb = ave_turb_ntu,
         DOsat = ave_DO_Saturation,
         Chl = ave_chl_microgperl,
         RH = Herring
         ) %>%
  select(Date, Station, Year, Yearf, Month, Season, DOY, riv_km, Temp, Sal, Turb, AvgTurb, 
         DOsat, Chl, RH, 
         combined_density,H, SEI,
         Acartia, Balanus, Eurytemora, Polychaete, Pseudocal, Temora) %>%
  arrange(Date, Station)
head(base_data)
```

```{r}
rm(station_data)
```

### Add Transformed Predictors
We can treat the sampling history as "spring", "summer" and "fall" observations 
each year from 2013 through 2017.  This breaks the temporal pattern down 
into integer valued time, generating a "quasi regular" time series, and
allowing us to simplify the analysis of temporal autocorrelation.  The "real 
world" time difference across the winter is longer that between seasons, but  I
could not find a ready way to address that.

We need both the numerical sequence and a factor later, for different purposes.

```{r}
base_data <- base_data %>%
  mutate(sample_seq = as.numeric(Season) + (Year-2013)*3,
         sample_event = factor(sample_seq))
```


# Environmental Predictors
First, we look at simple linear models to predict our environmental predictors.
this gives us a way to understand how the predictors are related to location and
season in the estuary.

I automate the analysis using a nested tibble.

First I create a "Long" data source.
```{r}
env_data <- base_data %>%
  select(Yearf, Month, Season, sample_event, Station, Temp,
          Sal, Turb, Chl, DOsat) %>%
  mutate(Turb = log(Turb),
         Chl = log(Chl)) %>%
  pivot_longer(-c(Yearf:Station), names_to = 'Parameter', values_to = 'Value')
```

Next, I create a function to run the analysis.  This function takes a data frame
or tibble as an argument.  The tibble mush have data columns with the correct 
names, and all variables transformed before we call it.


```{r}
my_lme <- function(.dat) {
  
  lme(Value ~ Station * Season,
      random = list(Yearf = ~ 1, sample_event = ~ 1),
      data = .dat, na.action = na.omit)
}
```

Finally, We run the analysis on the nested tibble.
```{r}
env_analysis <- env_data %>%
  group_by(Parameter) %>%
  nest() %>%
  mutate(lme_mods = map(data, my_lme))

```

## Temperature
```{r}
parm = 'Temp'
mod <- env_analysis$lme_mods[env_analysis$Parameter == parm][[1]]
anova(mod)
```

Temperature is affected by Season, Station, and their interaction.

```{r}
emmip(mod, Station ~ Season)
emmeans(mod, pairwise ~ Station | Season)
```
Stations 2, 3 and 4 pretty much all work the same way, with Spring significantly
cooler than summer and fall.  But water temperatures upstream begin to drop in
the fall at Station 1, perhaps because of lower freshwater inflows, perhaps 
because waters on land begin to cool before ocean waters.

## Salinity
```{r}
parm = 'Sal'
mod <- env_analysis$lme_mods[env_analysis$Parameter == parm][[1]]
anova(mod)
```

Salinity is also affected by Season, Station, and their interaction.

```{r}
emmip(mod, Station ~ Season)
emmeans(mod, pairwise ~ Station | Season)
```

Station 1 has lower salinity all year long, but the effect is MUCH larger in
spring.  The other three stations show very similar patterns, with no clear
differences, but slightly lower salinities in Spring.

## Turbidity
(Turbidity was analysed as a log transform)
```{r}
parm = 'Turb'
mod <- env_analysis$lme_mods[env_analysis$Parameter == parm][[1]]
anova(mod)
```

Turbidity does NOT show a significant effect of Season or of the Season by 
Station interaction, so we need only consider the Station predictor. To handle 
this carefully, I refit a model omitting those terms. 

```{r fig.width = 3, fig.height = 2}
tmp <- env_analysis$data[env_analysis$Parameter == parm][[1]]
test <- lme(Value ~ Station,
       random = list(Yearf = ~ 1, sample_event = ~ 1),
      data = tmp, na.action = na.omit)
(emm <- emmeans(test, pairwise~ Station))
plot(emm)
```

Generally, Stations 1 and 2 are associated with higher Turbidity compared to
stations 3 and 4.


## Chlorophyll
(Also log transformed for analysis)
```{r}
parm = 'Chl'
mod <- env_analysis$lme_mods[env_analysis$Parameter == parm][[1]]
anova(mod)
```

The interaction term is not significant, but this time both main effects are 
significant.

```{r fig.width = 3, fig.height = 2}
tmp <- env_analysis$data[env_analysis$Parameter == parm][[1]]
test <- lme(Value ~ Station + Season,
       random = list(Yearf = ~ 1, sample_event = ~ 1),
      data = tmp, na.action = na.omit)
 
(emm_stat <- emmeans(test, pairwise~ Station))
plot(emm_stat)

(emm_seas<- emmeans(test, pairwise~ Season))
plot(emm_seas)
```

Generally, Station 1 and Spring are associated with lower chlorophyll.

The only statistically significant differences in Station show Station 1 is 
different from Station 2 and 4 (but not 3).

Spring is different from Summer and ALMOST different from fall.


## Dissolved Oxygen Percent Saturation
```{r}
parm = 'DOsat'
mod <- env_analysis$lme_mods[env_analysis$Parameter == parm][[1]]
anova(mod)
```

```{r fig.width = 3, fig.height = 2}
tmp <- env_analysis$data[env_analysis$Parameter == parm][[1]]
test <- lme(Value ~ Station + Season,
       random = list(Yearf = ~ 1, sample_event = ~ 1),
      data = tmp, na.action = na.omit)
 
(emm_stat <- emmeans(test, pairwise~ Station))
plot(emm_stat)

(emm_seas<- emmeans(test, pairwise~ Season))
plot(emm_seas)
```


Differences by station are significant, but small, with the only meaningful
pairwise comparison comparing Station 1 different from Station 2. Seasonal 
patterns are  easier to interpret, with lower DO Saturation in the fall.

## Discussion
Most of the environmental variables show patterns that can be readily 
explained in terms of estuarine processes, especially circulation and seasonal 
input of freshwater into the upper estuary.

The three of the five environmental variables -- Temperature, Salinity and 
Chlorophyll show an important similar pattern: The spring is different from
the other two seasons and Station one is different from the other three 
stations.  This presumably reflects hydrodynamics and mixing processes.

Turbidity shows higher values at the two upstream stations, presumably because
those stations are associated with the location of the turbidity maximum in this 
estuary. Dissolved oxygen saturation declines over the course of the year.

density_gam <- gamm(log(combined_density) ~ 
                          Station + 
                          Season +
                          s(Temp, bs="ts") +

```
```{r}

```
## Plot the GAM
```{r}
oldpar <- par(mfrow = c(2,3))
plot(density_gam$gam)
par(oldpar)
```

## Station and Season
```{r fig.width = 3, fig.height = 2}
Sta_emms <- emmeans(density_gam, ~Station, type = 'response', 
                    data = base_data)
plot(Sta_emms)
pairs(Sta_emms, adjust ='bonferroni')
```

```{r fig.width = 3, fig.height = 2}
Seas_emms <- emmeans(density_gam, ~Season, type = 'response',
                     data = base_data)
plot(Seas_emms)
pairs(Seas_emms, adjust ='bonferroni')
```
### Model Diagnostics

```{r fig.width = 5, fig.height = 5}
oldpar <- par(mfrow = c(2,2))
gam.check(density_gam$gam)
par(oldpar)
```

One low value is a serious outlier -- it corresponds to one of the spring 
"washout" events.  Those "washout" events have a large impact on model fit,
especially the substantial non-linearity in the Salinity response.

## Discussion
*  The Station differences are significant by ANOVA F test.  Pairwise
   comparisons show that Station 1 (upstream) shows the highest combined 
   density, which is significantly higher than for Stations 2 and 4, but not
   different from Station 3 (by multiple comparisons test anyway). There are no
   meaningful differences among the three downstream Stations.
   
*  While zooplankton density varies by season, only the Spring-Summer pairwise 
   comparisons of marginal means is individually significant. Densities are 
   somewhat higher in the spring than later in the year.
   
*  Salinity Shows a highly significant curved (~ 3 edf) pattern, driven largely
   by a couple of very low salinity, low density samples from Station 1 in the 
   Spring.

*  Turbidity and Chlorophyll both fit close to linear (~ 1 edf) relationships
   that appear fairly robust to model specification.  Zooplankton abundance is
   correlated with higher chlorophyll and higher turbidity.  (it's not 
   unreasonable to test for a significant interaction there, but I have not done
   so.)

# Shannon Diversity
## Histogram
To decide whether we can proceed with analysis of untransformed values.

```{r fig.width = 3, fig.height = 2}
base_data %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = H))+
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 0.2)
```

## Gaussian GAM with an Identity Link
### Summary and Anova
```{r}
shannon_gam <- gam(H ~ Station + 
                     Season +
                     s(Temp, bs="ts") +
                     s(Sal, bs="ts") + 
                     s(log(Turb), bs="ts") + 
                     s(log(Chl), bs="ts") + 
                     s(log1p(RH),bs="ts"),
                   random = list(Yearf = ~ 1, sample_event = ~ 1),
                   data = base_data, family = 'gaussian')
summary(shannon_gam)
```

```{r}
anova(shannon_gam)
```

## Plot the GAM
```{r}
oldpar <- par(mfrow = c(2,3))
plot(shannon_gam)
par(oldpar)
```

While the GAMM fits curves for several predictors, only the relationship with
salinity is retained in the model as statistically significant.  It appears
much of that pattern is driven by a couple of low salinity samples.  This model
is rather unsatisfying, as it finds no robust significant relationships.  We may
want to evaluate similar models with fewer parameters to see if we can extract 
more wisdom.

### Diagnostic Plots
```{r fig.width = 5, fig.height = 5}
oldpar <- par(mfrow = c(2,2))
gam.check(shannon_gam)
par(oldpar)
```

Not a bad model from a diagnostics point of view. If only we had learned
something useful from it.

# Model of River Herring Abundance
## Summary and ANOVA
```{r}
herring_gam <- gam(log1p(RH) ~ Station + 
                     Season +
                     s(Temp, bs="ts") +
                     s(Sal, bs="ts") + 
                     s(log(Turb), bs="ts") + 
                     s(log(Chl), bs="ts") + 
                     s(log1p(combined_density),bs="ts"),
                   random = list(Yearf = ~ 1, sample_event = ~ 1),
                   data = base_data, family = 'gaussian')
summary(herring_gam)
```

```{r}
anova(herring_gam)
```

Note that overall, Station is NOT statistically significant by F test, although
individual parameters ARE significant by T test. The usual statistical advice is
that to avoid making claims on weak evidence, one should not interpret
individual parameters within a factor unless the overall comparison is
significant.  Here the issue is that the Spring sample is the base case in the 
parameter table, and Spring is moderately different from all other seasons. 

While the GAMM fits curves for several predictors, only the relationship with
Turbidity in the model is statistically significant. The relationship is
essentially linear (EDF = 0.87).

## Plot GAM results
```{r}
oldpar <- par(mfrow = c(2,3))
plot(herring_gam)
par(oldpar)
```
## Model Diagnostics
```{r fig.width = 5, fig.height = 5}
oldpar <- par(mfrow = c(2,2))
gam.check(shannon_gam)
par(oldpar)
```

The model is pretty good, with only slightly skewed residuals.

# Single Species Models
## Model Choice
Our model alternatives are similar to the choices we had for the Total Density 
model. The problem is, we can't use any of the continuous data distributions in 
GAMS with zero values (at least relying on the canonical link functions) because
(log(0) = -Inf; 1/0 = Inf, 1 / 0*0 = Inf). The easiest solution is to add some 
finite small quantity to the density data, and predict that. Here we predict
log(Density + 1) using Gaussian models.

## Automating Analysis of Separate Species
I'm going to automate analysis of all selected species by using a "nested"
Tibble.  This is a convenient alternative to writing a "for" loop to run
multiple identical analyses.

I create a "long" data source.

```{r}
spp_data <- base_data %>%
  select(Yearf, Month, Season, sample_event, Station, Temp,
          Sal, Turb, Chl, RH, 
          Acartia, Balanus, Eurytemora, Polychaete, Pseudocal, Temora) %>%
  pivot_longer(-c(Yearf:RH), names_to = 'Species', values_to = 'Density')
```

Next, I create a function to run the analysis.  This function takes a data frame
or tibble as an argument.  The tibble mush have data columns with the correct 
names.

The initial model fits for some species had a lot of wiggles in them, to an 
extent that I thought did not make much scientific sense, so I decided to reduce
the dimensionality of the GAM smoothers, by adding the parameter `k= 4`. Lowe
numbers constrain the GAM to fit smoother lines.

```{r}
my_gamm <- function(.dat) {
  
  gam(log1p(Density) ~ Station + 
        Season +
        s(Temp, bs="ts", k = 4) +
        s(Sal, bs="ts", k = 4) + 
        s(log(Turb), bs="ts", k = 4) + 
        s(log(Chl), bs="ts", k = 4) + 
        s(log1p(RH),bs="ts", k = 4),
      random = list(Yearf = ~ 1, sample_event = ~ 1),
      data = .dat, family = "gaussian")
}
```


Next, I create the nested tibble, and conduct the analysis on each species....

```{r}
spp_analysis <- spp_data %>%
  group_by(Species) %>%
  nest() %>%
  mutate(gam_mods = map(data, my_gamm))
```

and finally, output the model results.  I can do that in a "for" loop, but it's 
Awkward to look through a long list of output, so I step through each species in turn.

## Polychaete
### Summary and ANOVA
```{r}
spp =  "Polychaete" 
mod <- spp_analysis$gam_mods[spp_analysis$Species == spp][[1]]
summary(mod)
cat('\n')
anova(mod)
```

### Comparison of Station and Season
I'm showing "marginal" means -- essentially means adjusted for the other 
predictors, at their mean values.
```{r fig.width = 3, fig.height = 2}
Sta_emms <- emmeans(mod, ~Station, type = 'response', 
                    data = spp_analysis$data[spp_data$Species == spp][[1]])
plot(Sta_emms)
pairs(Sta_emms, adjust ='bonferroni')
```
