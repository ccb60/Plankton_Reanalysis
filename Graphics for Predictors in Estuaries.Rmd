# Introduction
A central challenge of making sense of ecological processes complex estuary 
environments is that conditions in the estuary vary in complex ways in time and 
space.  Mixing of fresh and salt water creates steep three dimensional ecotones
of salinity, temperature, and water density.  Those ecotones drive local
hydrodynamics that can concentrate nutrients or particulates in certain times or
places, while diluting them or washing them out of the estuary elsewhere. The 
ecotones themselves shape the spatio-temporal structure of other "predictors" of 
zooplankton abundance

In this notebook, I look at ideas for graphically showing the spatio-temporal 
structure of  predictors.

# A Side Note
Depth-related data from vertical profiles, especially of salinity and 
temperature (and thus water density) would provide another way of looking at the 
spatio-temporal structure of the data.  I do not have access to full profile 
data.  If you do have that available, interpolated "profile" plots of predictors 
up and down the estuary are great, but there end up being a lot of them...

I wrote a small R package, `tdggraph`, available via the 
[CBEP GitHub page](https://github.com/CBEP-SoCB/tdggraph.git) 
to facilitate making "interpolated" graphics based on vertical profiles.  It's
still slightly buggy, but it means this is feasible entirely in R.

```{r folder_refs}
data_folder <- "Original_Data"
```

## Load Data From Source
```{r load_enviro_data}
filename.in <- "penob.station.data EA 3.12.20.xlsx"
file_path <- file.path(data_folder, filename.in)
station_data <- read_excel(file_path, 
                           sheet="Final", col_types = c("skip", "date", 
                                              "numeric", "text", "numeric",

                                              "skip", 
                                              rep("numeric", 10),
                                              "text", 
                                              rep("numeric", 47),
                                              "text",
                                              rep("numeric", 12))) %>%
  rename_with(~ gsub(" ", "_", .x)) %>%
  rename_with(~ gsub("\\.", "_", .x)) %>%
  rename_with(~ gsub("\\?", "", .x)) %>%
  rename_with(~ gsub("%", "pct", .x)) %>%
  rename_with(~ gsub("_Abundance", "", .x)) %>%
  filter(! is.na(date))
station_data <- station_data %>%
  mutate(station = factor(as.numeric(factor(station))))
```

## Subsetting to Desired Data
I base selection of predictor variables here on the ones used for the 
environmental loading in the community analysis.  It's not obvious to me that
these are the right indicators.  It may be easier to understand patterns in
terms of time of year or relative location in the estuary.

```{r build_env_data}
base_data <- station_data %>%
  rename(Date = date, 
         Station = station,
         Year = year) %>%
  select(-c(month, month_num)) %>%
  mutate(Month = factor(as.numeric(format(Date, format = '%m')),
                                                levels = 1:12, 
                                                labels = month.abb),
         DOY = as.numeric(format(Date,format = '%j'))) %>%
  mutate(season = factor(season, levels = c('Spring', 'Summer', 'Fall'))) %>%
  rename(Season = season,
         Temp = ave_temp_c,
         Sal = ave_sal_psu,
         Turb = sur_turb,
         AvgTurb = ave_turb_ntu,
         DOsat = ave_DO_Saturation,
         Chl = ave_chl_microgperl,
         RH = Herring
         ) %>%
  select(Date, Station, Year, Month, Season, DOY, riv_km, Temp, Sal, Turb, AvgTurb, 
         DOsat, Chl, RH, 
         combined_density,H, SEI,
         Acartia, Balanus, Eurytemora, Polychaete, Pseudocal, Temora) %>%
  arrange(Date, Station)
head(base_data)
```

```{r}
rm(station_data)
```

## "Long" Version of the Data
```{r}
long_data <- base_data %>%
  select(-c(H:Temora,  AvgTurb, DOsat)) %>%
  pivot_longer(-c(Date:riv_km, combined_density), 
               names_to = 'Predictor', values_to = 'Values') %>%
  mutate(Predictor = factor(Predictor, 
                            levels = c('Temp', 'Sal', 'Turb',
                                                  'Chl', 'RH'),
                            labels = c("Temperature", "Salinity", "Turbidity",
                                       "Chlorophyll", "River Herring")))
```

### Add Fancy Labels for Figures
These fancy labels are expressions, which allows me to include non-standard
glyphs, greek letters, superscripts, etc.

```{r} 
plain_labels = levels = c("Temperature",
                          "Salinity", 
                          "Turbidity",
                          "Chlorophyll", 
                          "River Herring")

fancy_labels =  c(expression("Temperature (" * degree * "C)"),
                  expression("Salinity" ~ "(PSU)"),
                  expression("Turbidity" ~ "(NTU)"),
                  expression("Chlorophyll (" * mu * g * L ^-1 ~")"), 
                  expression("River Herring" ~  "(CPUE)"))

fancy_labels_2 =  c(expression("Temperature (" * degree * "C)"),
                    expression("Salinity" ~ "(PSU)"),
                    expression("Log(Turbidity)" ~ "(NTU)"),
                    expression("Log(Chlorophyll) (" * mu * g * L ^-1 ~")"), 
                    expression("Log(1 + River Herring)" ~  "(CPUE)"))

long_data <- long_data %>%
  mutate(fancy_p = factor(Predictor, levels = plain_labels, 
                        labels = fancy_labels))
```

### Add Transformed Predictors
```{r}
new_values <- base_data %>%
  select(-c(H:Temora,  AvgTurb, DOsat)) %>%
  mutate(Turb = log(Turb),
         Chl = log(Chl),
         RH = log1p(RH)) %>%
  pivot_longer(-c(Date:riv_km, combined_density), 
               names_to = 'Predictor', values_to = 'Values_2') %>%
  pull('Values_2')

long_data <- long_data %>%
  mutate(Transformed_Values = new_values,
         fancy_p_2 = factor(Predictor, levels = plain_labels, 
                        labels = fancy_labels_2))
```

### Add Mean River Kilometers
We will want a variable that replaces Site with the mean or median river km 
associated with that site, for graphing purposes.

```{r}
lookup <- base_data %>%
  group_by(Station) %>%
  summarize(mean_riv_km = round(mean(riv_km, na.rm = TRUE),1))

base_data <- base_data %>%
  left_join(lookup, by = 'Station')

long_data <- long_data %>%
  left_join(lookup, by = 'Station')
```

# Longitudinal "Slices" Down Estuary
## Three Possible Base Graphic Designs
I should be more selective about colors, legends, labels, etc.  These
preliminary graphics are just to get a sense of each layout.

### Longitudinal Traces for Each Day
```{r}
ggplot(base_data, aes(riv_km, Temp, group = factor(Date))) +
  geom_line(aes(color = Month))
```

### Means by Month and Station
We "recast" Station by the mean river kilometer of that station's data. This 
shows means plus bootstrapped 95% confidence intervals. An alternative with 
means and standard errors is also possible.  I selected the bootstrapped 95% 
confidence intervals because they are likely to work even with highly
skewed data.

(It occurs to me that I could add "raw" data behind the means and confidence 
intervals.)
```{r}
ggplot(base_data, aes(mean_riv_km, Temp)) +
    stat_summary(geom = 'line', 
                 aes(color = Season), 
                 fun = ,
                 alpha = 0.25) +
  stat_summary(aes(color = Season), 
               fun.data = mean_cl_boot,
               alpha = 0.75)
```

### Smoothers
This one could be simplified by suppressing some of the information, such as
the year of each observation.

```{r}
ggplot(base_data, aes(riv_km, Temp, color = Season)) +
  geom_smooth(mapping = aes(fill = Season), 
              method = 'gam', 
              formula = y ~ s(x, bs = "ts"),
              alpha = 0.2) +
  geom_point((aes(shape = factor(Year)))) +

  xlab('River Kilometer') +
  ylab('Temperature (C)') +
  
  scale_shape(name = 'Year') +
  
  # All the following is unnecessary here, since  these are mostly defaults, but
  # I Include them as reminders of how to control the legend.
  theme(legend.position = 'right', 
        legend.box = 'vertical',
        legend.title.align = 0) +
  guides(color = guide_legend(title.position = "top"),
         shape = guide_legend(title.position = "top"))
```
## Using `facet_wrap()` to Show Several Predictors
These could all be reshaped into five graphics vertically or horizontally, if 
that works better.

### All Longitudinal Profiles, Transformed Values
The vertical axis labels are now quite long, so I had to shrink the fonts.

```{r fig.width = 6, fig.height = 4}
ggplot(long_data, aes(riv_km, Transformed_Values, group = factor(Date))) +
  geom_line(aes(color = Season)) +
  theme_classic(base_size = 9.5) +
  theme(legend.position="bottom",
        strip.placement = 'outside',
        strip.background = element_blank()) +
  scale_color_viridis_d(name = '') +
  facet_wrap(~fancy_p_2, 
             scales = 'free_y', 
             nrow = 2,
             strip.position = 'left',
             labeller = label_parsed) +
  ylab('') +
  xlab('River Kilometer')
```

I find that too busy.

### All Monthly Summaries (on Transformed Predictors)
Again, the location is the mean river kilometers of all sampling events
associated with each Station.  The error bars are 95% bootstrap confidence 
intervals.

```{r fig.width = 7, fig.height = 3.5}
ggplot(long_data, aes(mean_riv_km, Transformed_Values)) +
  geom_point(aes(x = riv_km, y = Transformed_Values, 
                 shape = factor(Year), color = Season), 
             alpha = 0.25) +
  stat_summary(geom = 'line',
               aes(color = Season),
               fun=mean) +
  stat_summary(aes(color = Season), 
               fun.data = mean_cl_boot,  # could also try mean_se
               alpha = 0.75) +

  facet_wrap(~fancy_p_2, 
             scales = 'free_y', 
             nrow = 2,
             strip.position = 'left',
             labeller = label_parsed) +
  ylab('') +
  xlab('River Kilometer') +

  scale_shape(name = 'Year') +
  scale_color_viridis_d(name = 'Season') +

  theme_classic(base_size = 9.5) +
  theme(strip.placement = 'outside',
        strip.background = element_blank(),
        legend.position = c(.85, .175), 
        legend.box = 'horizontal',
        legend.title.align = 0.5,)
```


### All Smoothers
This is a big, complex graphic, with many custom adjustments...

1.  We have to split geom_smooth() into parts so we can independently control
    transparency of line and background. I am controlling the smoother 
    carefully, by specifying the nature of the smooth, here using a "GAM" 
    smoother, based on a thin plate spline, which tends to fit a fairly
    conservative.
    
2.  I show both the smoothing line and the 95% confidence band around each line.
    That feels like it is maybe too much.
    
3.  There are a lot of "custom" features here, mostly regarding layout, like
    whether to include alegend, what to call it, and how to label the "facets".
    
```{r fig.width = 7, fig.height = 3.5}
ggplot(long_data, aes(riv_km, Transformed_Values, color = Season)) +

  # First the error bands -- perhaps too much 
  stat_smooth(geom = 'ribbon',
              mapping= aes(fill = Season),
              method = 'gam',
              formula = y ~ s(x, bs = "ts"),
              alpha = 0.1,
              color = NA) +
  # Then the line smoother
  stat_smooth(geom = 'line',
              method = 'gam',
              formula = y ~ s(x, bs = "ts"),
              alpha = 0.3,
              size = .75) +
  # Add points ON TOP of the smoothers, to make them more visble
  geom_point((aes(shape = factor(Year)))) +

  facet_wrap(~fancy_p_2, 
             scales = 'free_y', 
             nrow = 2,
             strip.position = 'left',  # So they look like Y axis labels
             labeller = label_parsed) +  # To read formulae
  ylab('') +
  xlab('River Kilometer') +
  
  # Now, control all of the scales used, setting names, colors, and labeling
  scale_shape(name = 'Year') +
  scale_color_viridis_d(name = 'Season') +
  scale_fill_viridis_d(name = 'SSeason') +
  
  # And chose where to show the legends
  guides(color = guide_legend(title.position = "top"),
         fill = 'none',
         shape = guide_legend(title.position = "top")) +
  
  # Make the fonts slightly smaller than the default
  theme_classic(base_size = 9.5) +
  
  # and control various details
  theme( strip.placement = 'outside',         # like axis label
         strip.background = element_blank(),  # aesthetic choice
         legend.position = c(.85, .175),      # in the "blank" space
         legend.box = 'horizontal',           # legends side by side
         legend.title.align = 0.5,            # Centered over legend
         axis.text.x = element_text(hjust = -.2))  # Put labels right of ticks
```

# Temporal "Slices" at Each  Station 
## Initial Concept
```{r}
ggplot(base_data, aes(DOY, Temp, color = Station)) +
  geom_point((aes(shape = factor(Year)))) +
  geom_smooth(method = 'gam', formula = y ~ s(x, bs = "cs"), se = FALSE) +
  scale_shape(name = 'Year')
```

### All Temporal Slices
To make this look good, I need to create a month by month axis for 
Days of the Year by Month.

```{r}
days = c(31, 28, 31, 30, 31, 30, 31, 31, 30, 31, 30, 31)
cum_days = c(0, cumsum(days))[1:12]
names(cum_days) <- month.abb
cum_days
```


```{r fig.width = 7, fig.height = 3.5}
ggplot(long_data, aes(DOY, Transformed_Values, color = Station)) +

  # First the error bands -- perhaps too much 
  stat_smooth(geom = 'ribbon',
              mapping= aes(fill = Station),
              method = 'gam',
              formula = y ~ s(x, bs = "ts"),
              alpha = 0.1,
              color = NA) +
  # Then the line smoother
  stat_smooth(geom = 'line',
              method = 'gam',
              formula = y ~ s(x, bs = "ts"),
              alpha = 0.3,
              size = .75) +
  # Add points ON TOP of the smoothers, to make them more visible
  geom_point((aes(shape = factor(Year)))) +

  facet_wrap(~fancy_p_2, 
             scales = 'free_y', 
             nrow = 2,
             strip.position = 'left',
             labeller = label_parsed) +
  ylab('') +
  xlab('') +
  
  # Now, control all of the scales used, setting names, colors, and labeling
  scale_shape(name = 'Year') +
  scale_color_viridis_d(name = 'Station') +  #viridis palettes are colorblind friendly
  scale_fill_viridis_d(name = 'Station') +
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = cum_days, labels=month.abb) +
  
  # And chose legends, where to put names
  # you can do many other things with a call to `guides()`
  guides(color = guide_legend(title.position = "top"),
         fill = 'none',
         shape = guide_legend(title.position = "top")) +
  
  # Make the fonts slightly smaller than the default
  theme_classic(base_size = 9.5) +
  
  # and control various details
  theme( strip.placement = 'outside',         # Outside of axis, like axis label
         strip.background = element_blank(),  # An aesthetic choice
         legend.position = c(.85, .175),      # Located in the "blank" area
         legend.box = 'horizontal',           # Place two legends side by side
         legend.title.align = 0.5,            # Centered over the legend
         axis.text.x = element_text(hjust = -.25))  #Put labels right of ticks.
```
