# Introduction
One of my concerns with presenting the results of GAMs in a paper is that the
models are complex, and the results can't usually be readily represented in a
simple table. So, we need to think about potential graphic representation of the
model results.

One possible way to display GAM model results (at least for GAMs without any 
two or three dimensional smoothers) is by showing "slices" through the model 
space associated with each predictor.  The graphics would show the raw data,
plus predicted values from `emmeans()`. The graphics can be "stacked" or 
"wrapped" into one graphic for compactness.

In this notebook, I work out steps needed to do that using `ggplot()`.

It may be worth noting that while poking around online, I also found an 
interesting package, called `mgcVis` that has graphics facilities for GAMS, 
but I have not explored that packages capabilities.

# Load Libraries
```{r libraries, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(readxl)
library(mgcv)      # for GAM models

```

# Folder Reference
```{r folder_refs}
data_folder <- "Original_Data"
```

# Load Data
```{r load_enviro_data}
filename.in <- "penob.station.data EA 3.12.20.xlsx"
file_path <- file.path(data_folder, filename.in)
station_data <- read_excel(file_path, 
                           sheet="Final", col_types = c("skip", "date", 
                                              "numeric", "text", "numeric", 
                                              "text", "skip", "skip", 
                                              "skip", 
                                              rep("numeric", 10),
                                              "text", 
                                              rep("numeric", 47),
                                              "text",
                                              rep("numeric", 12))) %>%
  rename_with(~ gsub(" ", "_", .x)) %>%
  rename_with(~ gsub("\\.", "_", .x)) %>%
  rename_with(~ gsub("\\?", "", .x)) %>%
  rename_with(~ gsub("%", "pct", .x)) %>%
  rename_with(~ gsub("_Abundance", "", .x)) %>%
  filter(! is.na(date))
```

Station names are arbitrary, and Erin previously expressed interest in renaming 
them from Stations 2, 4, 5 and 8 to Stations 1,2,3,and 4.

The `factor()` function by default sorts levels before assigning numeric codes,
so a convenient way to replace the existing station codes with sequential
numbers is to create a factor and extract the numeric indicator values with 
`as.numeric()`.

```{r change_station_names_2}
station_data <- station_data %>%
  mutate(station = factor(as.numeric(factor(station))))
```

### Subsetting to Desired Data Columns
I base selection of predictor variables on the ones used in the manuscript.

```{r build_env_data}
base_data <- station_data %>%
  rename(Date = date, 
         Station = station,
         Year = year) %>%
  select(-c(month, month_num)) %>%
  mutate(Month = factor(as.numeric(format(Date, format = '%m')),
                                                levels = 1:12, 
                                                labels = month.abb),
         DOY = as.numeric(format(Date,format = '%j')),
         season = factor(season, levels = c('Spring', 'Summer', 'Fall')),
         Yearf = factor(Year)) %>%
  rename(Season = season,
         Temp = ave_temp_c,
         Sal = ave_sal_psu,
         Turb = sur_turb,
         AvgTurb = ave_turb_ntu,
         DOsat = ave_DO_Saturation,
         Chl = ave_chl_microgperl,
         RH = Herring
         ) %>%
  select(Date, Station, Year, Yearf, Month, Season, DOY, riv_km, Temp, Sal, Turb, AvgTurb, 
         DOsat, Chl, RH, 
         combined_density,H, SEI,
         Acartia, Balanus, Eurytemora, Polychaete, Pseudocal, Temora) %>%
  arrange(Date, Station)
```

```{r}
rm(station_data)
```

# A Test GAM Model
I picked the gamma GLM for total zooplankton abundance, in part because it is a 
complicated model.  If I can make graphics work for this one, the same methods
will work for other models too.

```{r}
test_gam <- gam(combined_density ~
                              Station + 
                              s(Temp, bs="ts") +
                              s(Sal, bs="ts") + 
                              s(log(Turb), bs="ts") + 
                              s(log(Chl), bs="ts") + 
                              s(log1p(RH),bs="ts"),
                              data = base_data, family = 'Gamma')
summary(test_gam)
```

The important finding is that only the first three predictors are likely to
have any value. 

# Marginal Predictions
We want to look at marginal predictions across each predictor. The tool for this
is the`emmeans` package.

A "marginal" prediction estimates the mean value of the response variable,
while varying the value of only one predictor, and holding the value of all
**other** predictors fixed. Ordinarily, the other predictors are fixed to some
"typical" level. I use  median values, but the mean is more common, and would
also make sense.

## An Example
Here's what I have in mind, calculating and then plotting the marginal means 
(predictions) for various levels of Temperature, while holding all other 
predictors constant.

I  calculate predictions at 40 locations. The number of locations affects the 
size of the data frame you are building and the resolution of your graphics.
In my experience, the number is not critical for smooth curves on small 
graphics, but if you see straight line segments in the output, up the number of 
fitted points.

```{r}
emm_temp <- as.data.frame(emmeans(test_gam, "Temp", 
                    at = list(Temp = seq(1, 20, 0.5)), 
                    cov.reduce = median,
                    type = 'response'))
```

We build a  `ggplot()` graphic showing the marginal effect of temperature  
like this:

First a scatter plot of the underlying data....

```{r}
base_plt <- base_data %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = Temp, y = combined_density)) +
  geom_point(aes(color = Sal)) +
  scale_color_viridis_c(name = 'Salinity (NTU)') +
  xlab(expression(paste(degrees, 'C'))) +
  ylab(expression (paste('Zooplankton Density (', m^-3, ')')))
```

Then add the prediction line.  that is a statistically significant increase 
in zooplankton abundance, associated with  higher temperatures.

```{r fig.width = 5, fig.height = 3}
base_plt + 
  geom_line(data = emm_temp, aes(x = Temp, y = response))
```

## Calculate `emmeans()` for other predictors
I have to decide the range over which to plot the predictions for each 
predictor. I do that by looking at the observed range of that predictor, and 
selecting "pretty" limits just outside that range.

```{r}
range(base_data$Sal)
emm_sal <- as.data.frame(emmeans(test_gam, "Sal", 
                    at = list(Sal = seq(0, 30, 0.5)), 
                    cov.reduce = median,
                    type = 'response'))
```

Turbidity entered the model as a log transform.  The package `emmeans()` 
remembers that it did so, and handles the transform "behind the scenes", so 
you can specify the untransformed predictor. The same is true for the remaining
transformed predictors.

### Turbidity
```{r}
range(base_data$Turb)
emm_turb <- as.data.frame(emmeans(test_gam, "Turb", 
                    at = list(Turb = seq(1, 15, 0.25)), 
                    cov.reduce = median,
                    type = 'response'))
```

### Chlorophyll
```{r}
range(base_data$Chl)
emm_chl <- as.data.frame(emmeans(test_gam, "Chl", 
                    at = list(Chl = seq(1, 18, 0.5)), 
                    cov.reduce = median,
                    type = 'response'))
```

### River Herring
```{r}
range(base_data$RH, na.rm = TRUE)
emm_rh <- as.data.frame(emmeans(test_gam, "RH", 
                    at = list(RH = seq(0, 3000, 50)), 
                    cov.reduce = median,
                    type = 'response'))
```

# Data For One Combined Graphic
We need to construct a data set suited to building a multi-panel display using 
`facet_wrap()`. That requires us to build a "long" data frame that replicates 
the observations once for every predictor, so we can facet according to the
predictor.

## A "Long" Version of the Data
I change the names of the predictors just to make facet labels a little easier
to read.  I'll get fancier with facet labels later.

```{r}
long_data <- base_data %>%
  select(-c(H:Temora,  AvgTurb, DOsat)) %>%
  pivot_longer(-c(Date:riv_km, combined_density), 
               names_to = 'Predictor', values_to = 'Values') %>%
  mutate(Predictor = factor(Predictor, 
                            levels = c('Temp', 'Sal', 'Turb',
                                                  'Chl', 'RH'),
                            labels = c("Temperature", "Salinity", "Turbidity",
                                       "Chlorophyll", "River Herring")))
```

## Long Data for Predictions.
Now we generate a data set to provide the prediction lines. The goal is similar:
a long data frame coded by the predictor we want on the X axis.

```{r  fig.width = 3, fig.height = 6}
predicts <- 
   bind_rows(Temperature = emm_temp, Salinity = emm_sal, Turbidity = emm_turb, 
             Chlorophyll = emm_chl, 'River Herring' = emm_rh, 
             .id = 'Predictor')
```

As we load each prediction data frame, it creates a new column named after the 
predictor in the GAM model. Each column is only defined for the values loaded
from that data frame.  It is `NA` everywhere else.  A sum using `a + b + c` 
would always return NA.  But, we can add multiple columns together while 
ignoring any `NA`s using `rowSums(..., na.rm = TRUE)`.

If the two data frames are going plot correctly on one faceted plot, the 
`Predictor` factor here has to match the `Predictor` factor from the previous 
data frame (name and levels).  

```{R}
Value = rowSums(predicts[,c('Temp', 'Sal', 'Turb', 'Chl', 'RH')],
                         na.rm=TRUE)
predicts <- predicts %>%
  mutate(Value = Value) %>%
  mutate(Predictor = factor(Predictor, 
                            levels = c("Temperature", "Salinity", "Turbidity",
                                       "Chlorophyll", "River Herring"))) %>%
  select(-c(Temp, Sal, Turb, Chl, RH))
```

### Add Fancy Labels for Figures
These fancy labels are expressions, which allows me to include non-standard
glyphs, Greek letters, superscripts, etc.  They come in handy later, but I add 
them here because they are part of building the data frames for plotting.

```{r} 
plain_labels = levels = c("Temperature",
                          "Salinity", 
                          "Turbidity",
                          "Chlorophyll", 
                          "River Herring")

fancy_labels =  c(expression("Temperature (" * degree * "C)"),
                  expression("Salinity" ~ "(PSU)"),
                  expression("Turbidity" ~ "(NTU)"),
                  expression("Chlorophyll (" * mu * g * L ^-1 ~")"), 
                  expression("River Herring" ~  "(CPUE)"))

long_data <- long_data %>%
  mutate(fancy_p = factor(Predictor, levels = plain_labels, 
                        labels = fancy_labels))
predicts <- predicts %>%
  mutate(fancy_p = factor(Predictor, levels = plain_labels, 
                        labels = fancy_labels))
```

### Add Transformed Predictors
Again, we won't need this for a while, but it's handy later on.

```{r}
new_values <- base_data %>%
  select(-c(H:Temora,  AvgTurb, DOsat)) %>%
  mutate(Turb = log(Turb),
         Chl = log(Chl),
         RH = log1p(RH)) %>%
  pivot_longer(-c(Date:riv_km, combined_density), 
               names_to = 'Predictor', values_to = 'Values_2') %>%
  pull('Values_2')

fancy_labels_2 =  c(expression(atop("Temperature", "(" * degree * "C)")),
                    expression(atop("Salinity", "(PSU)")),
                    expression(atop("Log(Turbidity)", "(NTU)")),
                    expression(atop("Log(Chlorophyll)", 
                                    "(" * mu * g * L ^-1 ~")")), 
                    expression(atop("Log(1 + River Herring)",  "(CPUE)")))

long_data <- long_data %>%
  mutate(Transformed_Values = new_values,
         fancy_p_2 = factor(Predictor, levels = plain_labels, 
                        labels = fancy_labels_2))

predicts <- predicts %>%
  mutate(Transformed_Values = case_when(
                      Predictor %in% c('Temperature', 'Salinity') ~ Value,
                      Predictor %in% c('Turbidity', 'Chlorophyll') ~ log(Value),
                      Predictor == 'River Herring' ~ log1p(Value)),
         fancy_p_2 = factor(Predictor, levels = plain_labels, 
                        labels = fancy_labels_2))
```

# Draft Graphic
It turns out, `ggplot()` automatically rescales axes to contain the values to
be plotted.  Usually, that's a convenience, but here, the confidence intervals
are extremely wide, so the default y axis does not show the raw data well if I
include confidence intervals. I need to specify the y axis. The y range should 
be slightly larger than the range  of the observed response variable.

```{r}
range(base_data$combined_density)
```

You can specify the axis limits two ways in `ggplot()`.  `ylim()` drops data 
outside the specified range.  That means any smoothers or summaries are based 
only on data visible on teh plot.  Often, that's not what you want.  You often
want to change the plot boundaries as though you are just "zooming in" on an
existing plat, without changing any calculations.  The tool for that is the 
`coord_cartesian()` function, used here.

```{r}
base_graphic = long_data %>%
  ggplot() +
  geom_point(data = long_data, aes(x = Values, 
                                   y = combined_density,
                                   color = Station)) +
    geom_line(data = predicts,
            mapping = aes(x = Value, y =response)) +
  xlab('') +
  ylab(expression (paste('Zooplankton Density ( ', m^-3, ')'))) +
    coord_cartesian(ylim = c(0, 17500)) +
  
  facet_wrap(~Predictor, scales = 'free_x', nrow = 2) +

  theme(legend.position = c(.85, .2), 
        legend.box = 'horizontal',
        legend.title.align = 0.5,)
base_graphic
```

### Add Error Bands
I could not get `geom_ribbon()` to work quite right.  It won't plot the error
band around the Turbidity predictor correctly, whether I specify the 
coordinated with `coord_cartesian()` or `ylim()`. So I ended up just drawing
dashed lines to show the 95% confidence intervals.

```{r}
base_graphic +
  geom_line(data = predicts, 
              mapping = aes(x = Value, y = lower.CL), lty = 2, color = 'gray60') +
  geom_line(data = predicts, 
              mapping = aes(x = Value, y = upper.CL), lty = 2, color = 'gray60')
```

# Cleaning Things Up

Several things I'd like to do:

1.  Remove the ugly box around the facet labels
2.  Add units to the panel labels
3.  Experiment with different graphic formats

## Remove Box Around Facet Labels
```{r}
base_graphic +
  theme(strip.background = element_blank())
```

## Make Better Facet Labels
The problem of making better facet labels is a bit tricky, since I need to 
create a new factor with values carefully tailored to generate labels
that include units. The major trick here is that if I want to use Greek letters,
superscripts, etc. in the facet labels, I need to create a factor with labels 
defined with `expression()`, which will be parsed by `ggplot()`.  You  tell
`ggplot()` that you will pass it expressions by specifying 
`labeller = label_parsed` in the call to `facet_wrap()`.

We built the necessary machinery into the data frame already, here we see how it works.

## Three Alternative Layouts
```{r fig.width = 3, fig.height = 6}
fancy_graphic = long_data %>%
  ggplot(aes(Values, combined_density)) +
  geom_point(aes(color = Station)) +
  geom_line(data = predicts,
            mapping = aes(x = Value, y =response)) +
  geom_line(data = predicts, 
              mapping = aes(x = Value, y = lower.CL), lty = 2, color = 'gray') +
  geom_line(data = predicts, 
              mapping = aes(x = Value, y = upper.CL), lty = 2, color = 'gray') +
  xlab('') +
  ylab(expression (paste('Zooplankton Density ( ', m^-3, ')'))) +
  ylim(0, 17500) +
  

 theme(legend.position="bottom",
        strip.placement = 'outside',
        strip.background = element_blank())


fancy_graphic +
  facet_wrap(~fancy_p, 
             scales = 'free_x', 
             nrow = 5,
             strip.position = 'top',
             labeller = label_parsed) 
```

I also like `strip.position = 'bottom'`. It makes the facet labels function
like X axis labels.

```{r}
fancy_graphic +
  facet_wrap(~fancy_p, 
             scales = 'free_x', 
             nrow = 2,
             strip.position = 'bottom',
             labeller = label_parsed) +
  theme(legend.position = c(.85, .2), 
        legend.box = 'horizontal',
        legend.title.align = 0.5,)
```

I also like the horizontal layout.

```{r fig.width = 7, fig.height = 3.25}
fancy_graphic +
  facet_wrap(~fancy_p, 
             scales = 'free_x', 
             nrow = 1,
             strip.position = 'bottom',
             labeller = label_parsed) 
```

## Use Shapes, Not Color for the Station
```{r fig.width = 7, fig.height = 3.25}
alt_graphic = long_data %>%
  ggplot(aes(Values, combined_density)) +
 
  geom_line(data = predicts,
            mapping = aes(x = Value, y =response), size = 0.75) +
  geom_line(data = predicts, 
              mapping = aes(x = Value, y = lower.CL),
            lty = 2, color = 'gray60') +
  geom_line(data = predicts, 
              mapping = aes(x = Value, y = upper.CL), 
            lty = 2, color = 'gray60') +
  geom_point(aes(shape = Station)) +
  xlab('') +
  ylab(expression (paste('Zooplankton Density ( ', m^-3, ')'))) +
  ylim(0, 17500) +

  theme_classic(base_size = 10) +
  theme(legend.position="bottom",
        strip.placement = 'outside',
        strip.background = element_blank())

alt_graphic +
  facet_wrap(~fancy_p, 
             scales = 'free_x', 
             nrow = 1,
             strip.position = 'bottom',
             labeller = label_parsed)  #+
  # theme(legend.position = c(.85, .2), 
  #       legend.box = 'horizontal',
  #       legend.title.align = 0.5,)
```


# Add A Couple of Alternative Ideas  
Since the GAM model was based on transformed predictors, you may want to 
present the results using transformed x axis values.

It might also be nice to NOT show prediction lines and error bands when the 
predictors are not meaningful.  That just involves deleting the predicted values 
associated with certain from the predicts data frame.

I call `ggplot()` without arguments here, as it is slightly easier to control
layering of graphics from multiple data frames that way.  Each layer can now 
refer to its own data source.

The biggest problem with this design is that the long axis labels are 
problematic. Here I split them nto two rows, which works, but hte layout is not
great looking.
